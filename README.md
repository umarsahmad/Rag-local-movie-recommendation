# 🎬 TinyLlama Movie Chatbot (Local RAG App)

This project is a fully local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for movie data, built on:

- 🦙 TinyLlama (local 1.1B parameter LLM)
- 💾 Chroma vector store
- 🔎 LangChain for retrieval and prompt orchestration
- 🧠 Sentence-transformer embeddings

Ask questions like:

✅ *"Give me movie review for Inception"*  
✅ *"List movie titles with IMDB ratings 8"*  
✅ *"List movie titles with genres 'Drama','Thriller'"*  
✅ *"List movies directed by Christopher Nolan"*  

All answers are grounded in your local dataset of movies!

Example row:
